I am studying for the AWS architect associate exam and need to make flashcards for the lecture

EC2 reserved instnances

Here are my notes. Can you please point out any things that that I can add to my notes that might need fleshing out or have a better explaination as well as any factual inaccuracies: 


## Standard reserve
- use this for cheapest ec2 instance that is contiunally running for 1 or 3 years
## Scheduled Reserved
- long term, consistent usage that isn't continuous
- use cases:
	- batch processing daily for 5 hours starting at x time
	- weekly sales analysis on fridays
	- each month need an extra 100 hours of capacity to do special process
- can only use the capacity during that time window
- doesn't support all instance types or regions
- need to reserve at least 1.2k hours per year
- have to commit to at least 1 year

## Standard Reservations vs Capacity Reservations
- capacity reservation is when you have compute that can't tolerate interruptions (like due to a failure)
- There are billing and capacity aspects to capacity reservations
- regional reservations provide a billing discount to instances launched in an AZ in that region
	- flexible but do not reserve capacity in the AZ, which can be risky if an AZ fails
- zonal reservations provide a billing discount to instances in that region and reserve capacity
	- tradeoff is no benefits outside that AZ
- On Demand capacity reservations
	- ensures you will have capacity in an AZ
	- pay full on demand price
	- no term limits (don't have to buy into 1/3 years)
	- you pay regardless of using it

## Savings Plan
- make an hourly 1 or 3 year commitment to AWS usage
- reserve a general compute $ amount ($20 per hour for 3 years)
- or a specific EC2 Savings Plan - flexibility on size & OS
- currently applies to EC2, Fargate, and Lambda
	- you will get better savings if you only reserve 1 of the specific products
	- general compute savings plan is good if your org wants cost effective access to emerging architectures to experiment with
- products have normal ad savings plan rate
- once you go over time commitment, start using on demand rate
