I am studying for the AWS architect associate exam and need to make flashcards for the lecture

EC2 Reserved Instances

Here are my notes. Can you please output the flashcards to a text file that I can import into anki? please use tabs to seperate questions and answers. Please disregard any changes/additions/edits/suggestions you proposed that do not show up in the notes below: 

## Standard reserve
- use this for cheapest ec2 instance that is contiunally running for 1 or 3 years
## Scheduled Reserved
- long term, consistent usage that isn't continuous
- has been depricated in some regions
- use cases:
	- batch processing daily for 5 hours starting at x time
	- weekly sales analysis on fridays
	- each month need an extra 100 hours of capacity to do special process
- can only use the capacity during that time window
- doesn't support all instance types or regions
- need to reserve at least 1.2k hours per year
- have to commit to at least 1 year

## Standard Reservations vs Capacity Reservations
- capacity reservation is when you have compute that can't tolerate interruptions (like due to a failure)
- There are billing and capacity aspects to capacity reservations
- regional reservations provide a billing discount to instances launched in an AZ in that region
	- flexible but do not reserve capacity in the AZ, which can be risky if an AZ fails
- zonal reservations provide a billing discount to instances in that region and reserve capacity
	- tradeoff is no benefits outside that AZ
- On Demand capacity reservations
	- ensures you will have capacity in an AZ
	- pay full on demand price
	- no term limits (don't have to buy into 1/3 years)
	- you pay regardless of using it

## Savings Plan
- make an hourly 1 or 3 year commitment to AWS usage
- reserve a general compute $ amount ($20 per hour for 3 years)
- or a specific EC2 Savings Plan - flexibility on size & OS
- currently applies to EC2, Fargate, and Lambda
	- you will get better savings if you only reserve 1 of the specific products
	- general compute savings plan is good if your org wants cost effective access to emerging architectures to experiment with
- products have normal ad savings plan rate
- once you go over time commitment, start using on demand rate
