I am studying for the AWS architect associate exam and need to make flashcards for the lecture

ASG Lifecycle Hooks

Here are my notes. Can you please output the flashcards to a text file that I can import into anki? please use tabs to seperate questions and answers and after each answer do a carrige return so I can more easily look at each q&a in my text editor. Please disregard any changes/additions/edits/suggestions you proposed that do not show up in the notes below.: 

## Summary
Lifecycle hooks enable you to perform custom actions by _pausing_ instances as an Auto Scaling group launches or terminates them. When an instance is paused, it remains in a wait state either until you complete the lifecycle action using the **complete-lifecycle-action** command or the `CompleteLifecycleAction` operation, or until the timeout period ends (one hour by default).

## Overview
- When an ASG scales out or in, you can perform an action
	- Hook targets: Launch and Terminate
- instances are paused and wait 
	- If no action is taken before timeout, **default behavior is to ABANDON or CONTINUE**
		- based on how the lifecycle hook was configured (`DefaultResult`).
	- if the action items out, it can contiune or abandon the action
		- default timeout is 1 hour
	- you can use CompleteLifecycleAction operation to explicitly resume the process when the action is over 
- integrate with eventbridge or SNS notifications
	- you can use your actions to send an event to event bridge or send notifications to SNS topic
	- use this for custom automation workflows

## Visual
### Scale Out
- when instance gets scale out, it will enter PENDING state before going to InService
	- - **`Pending:Wait` → `Pending:Proceed` → `InService`**
	- pending:Wait is where we can take the actions
- example: load configurations
### Scale In
- **`Terminating:Wait` → `Terminating:Proceed` → `Terminated`**
- when scaling in, we take action in the Terminating:Proceed state
	- example: backup data or logs
